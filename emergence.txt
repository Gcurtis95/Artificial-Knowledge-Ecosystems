She sings into a karaoke mic, every sound, every word, every expletive uttered lasers out beams of light, bouncing off the walls before settling as hazy white holograms, the faces 
and bodies of the ex-global diaspora, lost during the 1st google war, now visible. The apparitions move and fuse with one another led by the gyrating of their fingertips, momentarily 
joining the whirlpool around the centre of the room before flaming out, transmuting into camote vines, quickly, burning away into invisibility. As the snake of the time-continuum bends 
and eats its tail, in that moment, the fusion of Philippine utterances, human, inhuman, past present and future are processed and congealed, the individual sonic organs, vessels, sinew 
and tissue of Pan-Philippine sounding ground together, digested, rebirthed into a new form analogous to the original frequency spectra, but of different shape. An instrument of Philippine 
audibility assumed in a manifestation wholly different.

We hang onto the bass, turning into camote vines. Emplaced, for tonight.
